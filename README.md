### Installation:

#### Recommended way:
* Go to the official Gnome Shell Extensions website: https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/240/
* Click on the “ON/OFF” button on the top-right of the page.
* If you don't see the extension, go to the [troubleshooting section](README.md#troubleshooting).

#### For developers:
* Clone the repository
* Go to the cloned directory
* run ```make``` command in the terminal
* Restart Gnome-shell. (ALT+F2, r, Enter)
* You may need to enable the extension via Gnome Extensions Application

### Troubleshooting:
* I don't see the ON/OFF button, or it's disabled, but I see a blue message on top of the website, with a message like: “To control GNOME Shell extensions using this site you must install GNOME Shell integration that…”. What should I do?
   * In this case, you must install the `chrome-gnome-shell` package on your system. For example, on Ubuntu, you should run: `sudo apt install chrome-gnome-shell`
* I enable the extension, but it doesn't appear and when I refresh the page, it's disabled again! Why?!
   * If you don't have `gnome-tweaks`, first install it. Then open it and go to the “extensions” section. There is a button in the title bar of the window, make sure it's enabled.
   * If you cannot see the “extensions” section in the `gnome-tweaks` application, congratulation, you are using a more up-to-date version of Gnome, so in this case, please use the `gnome-extensions` application and make sure the button is enabled.
* If none of the above works, you can install [Extension Manager](https://github.com/mjakeman/extension-manager#-installing), then install and activate the Persian Calendar extension through it. Extension Manager is a tool for managing GNOME Shell Extensions.
